About me
========


Carmelo Velardo obtained his MSc in Computer Science Engineer both from "Politecnico di Torino" (Turin, Italy) and from EURECOM (Sophia Antipolis, France).
He also achieved his Master for research studies from the “Ecole Doctorale STIC” (Sophia Antipolis, France) in "Image and geometry for multimedia and life modelling". 

After a short break as research assistant at the Universal Design Group of the Panasonic San Jose Laboratory in 2007, he then completed his Master studies at EURECOM to join later on as PhD student. 

In 2012 he successfully defended his PhD dissertation on “Anthropometry and Soft Biometrics for Smart Monitoring” under the supervision of Professor Jean-Luc Dugelay (EURECOM).

The same year he joined the Institute of Biomedical Engineering of the University of Oxford as Post Doctoral Research Assistant where he collaborates with Professor Lionel Tarassenko.

His interests include digital health systems, mobile health and ambient assisted living applications, patient behaviour and interaction with computerised systems, signal processing and machine learning.

He is now involved in several projects that intend to provide a unified, clinically validated approach to self-management and self-monitoring of chronic conditions (COPD, diabetes, heart failure, gestational diabetes, obesity).
